Hello

Nice to meet you.

I am the leader of the Nanook team of 3 Ukraine developers. 
As a creative and experienced software engineer, Our team is very interested in your job posting on Upwork.
We are very familiar with MVC PHP frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, etc.
Especially, we have strong expertise in Pixel Perfect Responsive Design using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, React.JS, Vue.JS, GSAP, Barba, and no-code page builder like wordpress, wix, bubble, etc.
So I think, we are a great fit for this role.
Of course, there are many freelancers online, but it will be very difficult to find a freelancer who works responsibly and honestly for clients.

We will respond immediately to the client's response and will always be by his side as the client waits for a solution.
We will take care of your project from start to finish. In addition, we will provide daily updates through Github and will complete one page per day perfectly.
We sincerely want to work on your project.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards.
